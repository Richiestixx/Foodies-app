A social diet app, in which you have a sponsor who helps you lose weight. You both take pictures of your meal and send it to each other, in an incentive to eat more healthy foods. 

The idea being, that if the other person is eating healthier food it will encourage you into doing so too, as you'll have to compare what you're eating.

Paying a monthly subscription to use the app will Incentives users to not cheat as they'll just be wasting their money otherwise. 

A sponsor can be another user, anywhere in the world, each user will act as another user’s sponsor, when they are not playing the game, user’s can interact with their sponsor. They can talk to each other about cravings for snacks, in an effort to curb empty calories. You and your sponsor will encourage each other, when those cravings are calling you to what you shouldn't be eating.

User’s can choose to play ‘locally’ by which we mean, they can choose to play against their friends. Or they choose to play ‘globally’. Playing ‘globally’ means the user will be assigned a sponsor who is ranked in a similar class. 

Class is defined by bmi, dietary needs, lifestyle, vegan / non vegan (vegans can choose whether they are happy to play with meat eaters or not) 

It is important that user’s inform us if they suffer from mental health issues attached to eating, such as anorexia. They will be specifically paired with health professionals, until they feel they are ready to go more global. Mental health professionals will play a big part in coaching specific users. As such they will receive free subscription to the game and salary from us.

A winner in the game, is not the user that has eaten the least amount of calories. Players win by eating the most healthy meal. Any players who are deliberately not eating healthily or falling well below their recommended daily intake, will be recategorised accordingly. This ensures their sponsor gets a better experience of the game and they get the chance to cultivate healthier eating habits.  

A larger social aspect within the app will be user rated meal and recipe sharing. The more users that do this and use app recipe's, the easier it will be for the app to estimate calories in a meal through machine learning. To begin with user’s will add calories to their dairy.

Daily winner board or loser board (depending on what is more effective) in which the winner or loser of the day will be placed in a League table. This will be another Incentive to users, to eat healthier and make better choices.

Ranking on the leaderboards can be determined by the least calories. Users posting calorie data that is dangerously low will be deemed 'losers' and repeat offenders will be paired with 'Experts' that can help them on a social level, to be more healthy. 

Experts will be verified users that are able and suited to help people with eating disorders, start eating more healthy. Experts can receive monetary rewards for successful rehabilitation.
